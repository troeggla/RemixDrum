## RemixDrum ESP32

This directory contains the code for RemixDrum adapted for the ESP32 platform.
More specifically, this code is intended to run on an Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3
using port D1 for capacitive touch sensing and an MPU6050 IMU for determining
acceleration and angular rotation.

Note that this project is intended to be compiled using the
[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) extension for Visual Studio code.
